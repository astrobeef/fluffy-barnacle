        I have been programming in C# for video game development over the past four years.  I learned all of my code from online tutorials: Unity and Youtube.  Starting this year, I began practicing 3D, lowpoly art to round myself out as a game developer.  Now I want to expand my knowledge as a programmer past front end game development.  In my free time, I play video games and Dungeons & Dragons with my friends.

        As for work, I started cooking in my junior year of high school.  I had never cooked at home, so I had nearly zero experience cooking.  I applied to a gourmet resturant, and the only question they asked me in my interview was : "When can you start?"  Turns out they were just desperate for a cook.  Now I have been cooking for three years, and I currently work at Snooze: a tasteful, fun, and fast paced resturant.
